I am currently a PhD student in Compter science (2021-Present) at the National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology ([INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en)), working with [Morpheo](https://www.inria.fr/en/morpheo) team and [VirtUs](https://www.inria.fr/en/virtus) team under the supervision of Dr. [Stefanie Wuhrer](https://swuhrer.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/) and Dr. [Anne-Helene Olivier](https://perso.univ-rennes2.fr/anne.helene.olivier). My research is centred arround 3D human motion generation and evaluation. More precisely, I am working on human motion retargeting, objective and subjective evaluation of virtual humans in animation and user studies.

I received, in 2021, an engineering degree in Telecommunications (EUR-ACE), specialization in data science and a research masterâ€™s Degree in Information Processing and Complexity of Living Systems, specialization in sound, perception and image from the National School of Engineering of Tunis ([ENIT](http://www.enit.rnu.tn/)). During my end-of-courses project (M2 internship), I worked in [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur) on non-stationary estimation of hyperparameters in inverse problems by Deep Learning.
